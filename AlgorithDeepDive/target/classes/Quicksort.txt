Quick sort is a divide and Conquer algorithm. This algorithm picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
There are many versions of quick sort algorithm that pick pivot in different ways but for our example, we'll are picking
 the pivot as the first element of the array
 The following are attributes of quick sort.
 - Quick sor is a non-stable algorithm, meaning it does not guarantee the order of same value element after it has been
 sorted.
 - Quick sort is a O(nlogn) algorithm
