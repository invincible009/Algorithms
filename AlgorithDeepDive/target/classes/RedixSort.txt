Radix sort works by sorting each digit from least significant digit. So in base 10 ( the decimal system ) radix sort by the
digits in the 1'a place, then the 10's place and so on. To do this, radix sort uses counting sort as a subroutine to sort the digits
in each place value. This means that for a three digits number in base 10, counting sort will be called to sort the first place numbers,
then it will be called to sort the second place number then it will be called to sort the last place numbers. At the end of the day,
the result will be a completly sorted list of numbers.
This sort applies to numbers(integers) and strings.

RadixSort is a stable sort which means it preserves the relative order of elements, that have thesame key value. This is very important to note.

Complexity of the radix sort
Radix sort can operate on n-digit numbers, where each digit can be one of at most b diffrent valuwa( since b is he base being used)
Radiz sort uses stable counting sort for each digit. therefore the total running time of the radix sort is O(d(n+b))
When d is a constant and b isn't larger than n ( in other words b =O(n)
Radix sort takes linear time.
